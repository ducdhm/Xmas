# Xmas
Really cool web page about Merry Christmas theme includes:
 * Fullscreen flash
 * Customizable wish
 * Customizable music song
 
## Config
 1. Copy music song you want to rename it to `music.mp3`
 2. Open `data.xml` and edit the HTML tags after `music=on&musicfile=music.mp3&mutebuttonvisible=true&textblock=`. Maybe you can edit only text inside HTML tags
